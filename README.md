- Some foods are not easily digestible due to lifestyle and metabolism differences.  
- Students with more physical activities require a higher nutrient intake, while others with a sedentary lifestyle need to be careful about overeating.  
- We must maintain a **daily diet routine** for better focus, discipline, and overall health.

> “A good diet is essential for a sharp mind and a disciplined student life.”
