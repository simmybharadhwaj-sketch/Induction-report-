### Session by HOD – Food Department  
The session was conducted by the **Head of the Food Department**, focusing on the importance of diet and its effects on our body. We learned that:  

- Different foods have different impacts depending on body type and digestion system.  
- Some foods are not easily digestible due to lifestyle and metabolism differences.  
- Students with more physical activities require a higher nutrient intake, while others with a sedentary lifestyle need to be careful about overeating.  
- We must maintain a **daily diet routine** for better focus, discipline, and overall health.  

The speaker also shared insights about **food marketing** and how even homemade products are not always consistent in quality. The key takeaway was:  

> “A good diet is essential for a sharp mind and a disciplined student life.”
